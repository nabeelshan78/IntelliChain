    "# Process Inputs: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**, a technique that significantly improves an LLM's reasoning ability by instructing it to \"think step-by-step\" before giving a final answer. ðŸ§ \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### What's Happening Here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of asking for a direct answer, we provide the model with a detailed, multi-step process in the **system prompt**. For a customer query, this process includes:\n",
    "1.  Identifying the product in the query.\n",
    "2.  Checking it against an internal product list.\n",
    "3.  Detecting and verifying any assumptions the user makes.\n",
    "4.  Formulating a polite and accurate final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Accuracy**: By breaking down complex problems, the model is less likely to make logical errors.\n",
    "* **Interpretability**: The model outputs its entire reasoning process, separated by delimiters (`####`). This \"inner monologue\" allows us to see exactly how it arrived at its conclusion, which is great for debugging.\n",
    "* **Final Answer Extraction**: The code demonstrates how to easily parse the model's full output to show only the clean, final response to the end-user, hiding the intermediate reasoning steps."
