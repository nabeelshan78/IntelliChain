# üöÄ IntelliBot: A Deep Dive into Building Production-Ready LLM Chatbots üí¨

![IntelliBot Showcase](outputs/chatbot_qa_1.png)

Welcome to **IntelliBot**, a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to engineering a sophisticated, reliable, and safe conversational AI. This project deconstructs the complex process of building an **end-to-end customer service chatbot** powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's `gpt-4o`.

We move beyond basic API calls and dive into the critical components of a production-grade system: input validation, structured data extraction, advanced reasoning, multi-step processing pipelines, and rigorous output evaluation.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts

This project is a hands-on tutorial covering the essential techniques for modern LLM application development:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting precise instructions (`system` prompts) to control the LLM's behavior, tone, and output format.
- **Safety & Security**: Implementing guardrails using moderation APIs and few-shot classification to detect and block harmful content and prompt injection attacks.
- **Structured Data Generation**: Forcing the LLM to return valid `JSON` objects, making its output reliable for downstream programmatic use.
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting to guide the model through multi-step reasoning processes, improving accuracy and transparency.
- **Systematic Pipelines**: Designing **multi-prompt chains** where the output of one LLM call becomes the input for the next, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps.
- **Fact-Checking & Validation**: Using a second "evaluator" LLM to check the primary LLM's output for factual consistency against source data, mitigating hallucinations.

## üîß The IntelliBot Pipeline

Every user query is processed through a robust, multi-stage pipeline to ensure the final response is safe, accurate, and helpful. This modular design is the cornerstone of building reliable AI systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **LLM API**: OpenAI (`gpt-4o`)
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `openai`: For interacting with the OpenAI API.
  - `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables (API keys).
  - `panel`: For creating the interactive chat UI.
  - `jupyter`: For running the notebooks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git](https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git)
cd chatbot
```

**2. Set Up Your API Key**
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```
The code will automatically load this key.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

The project is designed to be explored sequentially through the notebooks.

**1. Explore the Concepts**
Work through the notebooks `01` to `06` in order. Each notebook is self-contained and explains a key concept in the AI pipeline.

**2. Run the Final Chatbot**
The final, interactive chatbot can be launched by running the `07_End_to_End_Conversational_Agent.ipynb` notebook. The last cells use the `panel` library to create and display a chat interface directly in the notebook or as a separate web application.

To run as a web app, you might use a command like:
```bash
panel serve 07_End_to_End_Conversational_Agent.ipynb
```
